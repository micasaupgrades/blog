<p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">Y</span>ou’ve got homes to sell. And competition can be fierce. You’re looking for buyers that see the potential of a great home in a new community. With over a decade of working with home builders our team knows what motivates buyers and how upgrades can not only increase revenue but accelerate the sale of new homes. </p>

Here are some of the top ways upgrades make an impact:
<ol>
<li><b>Hook potential buyers</b> - with a digital tool that enables them to start designing (and planning upgrades) for their home right away.</li>

<li><b>Increase your margins</b> - by recommending your highest margin options digitally.</li>


<li><b>Differentiate from the competition</b> - by providing a modern and convenient way for them to design and customize their home.</li>


<li><b>Give buyers time to choose the best (and most profitable) upgrades</b> - with an on-demand digital design center that allows buyers enough time to see everything available to them.  Don’t let them miss something they may want in a new home.</li>


<li><b>Get them shopping sooner</b> - so buyers can start shopping right after signing the contract to buy their home.  Don’t lose momentum and make your buyers wait for an appointment.</li>


<li><b>Expand marketing efforts</b> - outside of the design center.  Giving you another avenue to promote your brand, especially to those who are reluctant to travel to the design center.</li>


<li><b>Create a sense of urgency to get sales</b> - by using a cutoff date.</li>


<li><b>Capture data to help you attract more buyers</b> - so you are marketing options to them based on their tastes.  Instinct is not everything so arm your designers with real data.</li>


<li><b>Keep your team accountable</b> - by seeing which designers are selling the most effectively.</li>


<li><b>Give your buyers a gentle push</b> - by watching your buyers’ activity and give them a marketing push in the right direction.</li>
</ol>
