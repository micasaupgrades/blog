<p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">W</span>e are constantly asking our builder clients:  what advantages do you see in using an online program to bolster your upgrades sales?</p>  
<p>
While some of our builders use MiCasa Upgradesâ€™ software, with physical samples of countertops and flooring in the sales office, many use a design center or show room as well.
</p>

<p>Considering these different approaches, we expected the answers, as to why they went digital, to vary.  We were wrong; the answers are remarkable similar.  Here they are:</p>

<ol>
	<li>We want to give our buyers an incredible experience shopping for upgrades.</li>
	<li>Design meetings are too long and time consuming.  We need to be more efficient with our staff. </li>
	<li>Our buyers are demanding it and in some ways doing it themselves.  They show up to design meetings with images on their phones and expect us to find those options.  It was somewhat embarrassing using printed design books.</li>
	<li>It will help us sell more upgrades and make more money.</li>
	<li>Our buyers were not seeing all upgrades available to them because there is only so much you can cover at design meetings.</li>
</ol>
<p>We were also surprised that the #4 reason was not at the top.  It really is all about the home buyer</p>
