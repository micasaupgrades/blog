<p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">O</span>n March 19th, Melia Homes, a Southern California builder known for their attention to detail and design, will be having their grand opening for <a href="http://meliahomes.com/communities/anderson-grove">Anderson Grove</a> in Yorba Linda, California.  Here at MiCasa Upgrades, we built the platform for Melia to sell their options online – a digital design center – and were fortunate to preview the homes prior to their grand opening.</p>  
<p>
Anderson Grove consists of 40 duet homes that seem to perfectly target that market’s buyer.  The homes, with 4 beds and 3 baths, range from 2,155-2,317 square feet – the ground floors feel open and spacious while the upstairs are well-designed to meet most families’ needs, including a “Technology Room” that provides a unique quiet space.
</p>

<p>We sat down with Kirk Chittick, Melia’s Vice President of Sales and Marketing and asked him a few questions:</p>
<p>MiCasa:  Exciting project, Kirk.  What attracted Melia to the site and drove your vision?</p>

<p>Kirk:  The first thing that strikes you is the location.  When you hear about an opportunity in Yorba Linda, you immediately think of the incredible schools and quality of life.  Then when you get to the site, its location is very well balanced.  It’s quiet, in an established neighborhood, yet very close to shopping, restaurants and other amenities.  That’s tough to beat.</p>

<p>MiCasa:  Tell us a bit about the target market and how that drove design choices.</p>

<p>Kirk:  We expect families will be a big part of our buyer pool.  Starting in the high $600,000’s, we are priced to attract some first time and first move-up buyers that are looking to access the area’s schools and amenities at a reasonable price.  The first floor is open with the kitchen, living and dining rooms creating a spacious feel that will be great for families to spend time together.  We also have a bedroom and a full bath downstairs - perfect for guests.  Upstairs, we tried to balance functionality with an appealing design and I think we were successful.</p>

<p>MiCasa:  We're in the options business so I have to ask, what do you expect your buyers to upgrade?</p>

<p>Kirk:  Our standard finishes are high quality but we do see some opportunities depending on that particular buyer’s needs.  We expect some buyers will upgrade flooring and countertops but we also see a real opportunity in technology and home automation.  The key for us is to provide flexibility in what we are offering so that our buyers can customize their home and make it their own.
</p>

<p>MiCasa:  Thanks Kirk!  We look forward to providing your buyers a digital shopping experience so they can do just that!</p>
