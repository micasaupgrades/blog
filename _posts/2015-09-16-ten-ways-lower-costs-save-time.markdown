<p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">T</span>ime is money.  It may be a cliche’, but you know from experience that it’s true.  When you and your team spend too much time on administrative tasks and inefficient processes that don’t produce revenue, it’s a business killer.  Plus, it’s just plain frustrating for all involved.  Building and selling new homes is a time-consuming business with tight margins and a lot of moving parts.  Every ounce of profit and efficiency impacts your bottom line.</p>

Here are some of the top ways upgrades can make a positive impact on costs and time for home builders:
<ol>
<li><b>Stay on Schedule</b> - Avoid complications with cutoff dates by clearly communicating them to buyers through automated processes so they know what to expect and you don’t have to spend time managing them.</li>

<li><b>No excuses in the field</b> - get your design team, homebuyers and field supervisors on the same page with one digital record of what is purchased in each home.  Reduce mistakes and eliminate excuses as selections are available to see in real time.</li>


<li><b>Cut your upgrades content management time to nothing</b> - we quickly swap products out without having to reprint new option books and notify all of your buyers.</li>


<li><b>Make design meetings shorter and more productive</b> - by previewing, showcasing and pre-selling upgrades to home buyers before they arrive at design meetings so they understand all options and are excited to make decisions.  <u>One designer can manage more buyers.</u></li>


<li><b>Save time chasing down your buyers to make selections</b> - with online reminders and notifications.  On MiCasa, buyers are shopping right away and not waiting for their design center meetings.  Momentum is everything.</li>


<li><b>Enable quick reporting to mortgage lenders</b> - through viewing and printing selections made by your buyers online and submitting those results directly to lenders.</li>


<li><b>Simplify change order processing</b> - with editable shopping carts and order forms.</li>


<li><b>Get up to speed on your buyers quickly</b>  - by reviewing their profile before meetings/calls.
</li>

<li><b>Eliminate time spent preparing options books</b> - as everything will already be online and is easily modified and customized to buyer preferences.</li>


<li><b>Empower buyers to easily manage more of the process</b> - decreasing their stress, your time and their complaints to you.</li>
</ol>

And if you’re not currently doing all of these things - how much time is all of this costing you?  What are the opportunity costs you might be incurring as a result?
