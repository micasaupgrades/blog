<p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">H</span>omebuyers in California’s Central Coast, known for its laid back attitude and refreshingly cool climate, are embracing the addition of a new community.  Celebrations II, in Santa Maria, by Somis Investments has been met by homebuyers with open arms and it’s easy to see why (hint:  great design at reasonable prices).
</p>  

<p>Celebrations II consists of 46 homes with 4 floorplans, each with 3 beds and up to 3 baths, ranging from 1,497-1,668 square feet – the design has today’s buyer in mind, with an open layout on the ground floor and efficiencies that make the homes live larger than their square footage (<a href="http://celebrationsii.com">take a look here</a>).</p>


<p>MiCasa Upgrades created the platform for Somis to sell their options online, giving us access to the insights of their President, Eric Taylor, and their design team.  Here are some of the things we learned from Eric:</p>

<p>
	MC:  Eric, you just opened a couple weeks ago and sales are off to a fast start.  What’s driving so many buyers to your community?
</p>
<p>
Eric:  There are two things that are going in our favor:  first, the Central Coast has been underserved by new communities for some time, so local buyers are excited to have an opportunity to buy new.  Second, it’s not good enough to just show up – the buyers are smart – we need to execute.  Our team correctly identified that local families want open floorplans, so that living areas complement each other, but also wanted a manageable amount of square footage.  We were able to pull that off.
</p>

<p>
MC:  We recently attended a design meeting with your team and your designer, Mercedes Brenan.  Tell us about your process for making selections for the Central Coast buyer.
</p>
<p>
Eric:  As you know, we are in Oxnard.  Design tastes change as you move up the Coast and we need to be sensitive to those subtleties.  As an example, color choices may change; grey tones that may be popular in LA are less prevalent in Santa Maria.  People here are down-to-earth and more modest, so we need to provide choices that meet the local character.
</p>
<p>
MC:  And deliver at the right price point?
Eric:  That’s right.  It does us no good to offer choices that people can’t afford.  Our team is great at working with our subs, such as Erickson Tile and Holiday Carpet, that can provide excellent options without breaking the bank. 
</p>
<p>
MC:  Thanks Eric!  We look forward to providing your buyers a digital shopping experience so they can do just that!
