<p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">H</span>ave your buyers ever shopped for upgrades on their smart phone? In an ever growing digital world, the way people are shopping for homes has been revolutionized. </p>

<p>Last year the California Assoc. of Realtors reported the percentage of homebuyers that found their homes online tripled in just 4 years, from 13% to 39% in 2014. In 2015, it’s been reported at 43%.</p>

<p>And this year, the National Association of Realtors reported a startling change in shopping behaviors:

</p>
<p>
Yes, you read that right. A growing number of buyers are shopping for their homes on their phone.
</p>


<p>Ensure you are capitalizing on this trend and not missing out on sales. Along with these trends, consumers have little patience for businesses that don’t serve their digital needs effectively. Often, if their needs aren’t met and are frustrated with their digital experience, they’re likely to leave a brand, product or service and never return. Customer acquisition costs are high - especially for homebuilders - so be sure you’re not losing buyers at the point of sale.</p>

<p>Are you allowing home buyers to shop for upgrades the way they want? Unless you are using MiCasa, the answer is probably no.</p>
