<p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">H</span>ow many days pass from the time your homebuyers sign a sales contract until their first design meeting?</p>  
<p>
We have been asking our builder and design center clients this question and the answer is usually around 30 days.  Sometimes the lag is only 14 days and occasionally, if cut-offs are coming, it can be shorter.
</p>
<p>14 days is a long time.  30 days is a really long time.  Why should you care?  <b>By maintaining momentum you will sell more homes and sell more upgrades.</b></p>

<p><b>Sell More Homes</b></p>

<p>How many of your competitors’ communities can your buyer visit in 30 days?  Why give them a chance to change their mind?  We all know selling upgrades increases buyers’ deposit amounts (i.e. their investment in your home) and decreases cancellation rates.  So get your buyers shopping for upgrades right away!</p>

<p><b>Sell More Upgrades</b></p>

<p>Consider these quotes:</p>
<i>
<p>
“Sales Momentum is also one of the hardest things to gain, and the easiest thing to lose.” 
</p>
<p>
“In physics, creating momentum takes 3 times the effort as sustaining momentum.”
</p>
</i>
<p>
You have your homebuyers’ complete attention the day they sign their sales contract.  They can’t wait to imagine the lifestyle their new home will afford them and are eager to complete their personal story by making design choices.  You should capitalize on this momentum rather than fight for their attention 30 days later.</p>


<p>
At MiCasa, our builders and design centers interact with their homebuyers immediately through an e-commerce site created for them.  Here are the results:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>70% of home buyers are shopping for upgrades within 24 hours</li>
	<li>90% within 72 hours</li>
	<li>100% within one week</li>
</ul>
